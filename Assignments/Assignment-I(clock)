----Verilog code for generating clock---

CODE:
module clock(clk,rising_edge);
input wire clk;
output reg [31:0] rising_edge;
reg [31:0] counter;
always @(posedge clk) begin
    counter <= counter + 1;
end

always @(posedge clk) begin
if (counter == 50000000) begin // 5 seconds with 10 MHz
    rising_edge <= rising_edge+ 1;
        counter <= 0;
    end
end

endmodule
